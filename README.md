# genes_transcript_expression
I provide a pipline for Differential Gene expression, Differential Transcript Expression and Differential Transcript Usage

I also provide a different way to do DTE analysis without using Swish (need inferential replicates from Salmon). We can do the analysis by using DESeq2
at transcript level.

Piplines for Differential Gene expression, Differential Transcript Expression are also provided.
